        <h2>Climate Justice </h2> 
        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Climate justice is a critical issue that seeks to address the intersection of climate change and social justice. It recognizes that climate change affects different communities unequally and that vulnerable communities are disproportionately impacted by the effects of climate change.</p>
        <p>Climate justice advocates believe that solutions to climate change must be equitable, and that addressing systemic inequalities is necessary to create a sustainable future for all people.</p>
        <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
        <p>Climate justice is important because it recognizes that climate change is not just an environmental issue, but also a social and economic issue. The people who are most affected by climate change are often those who are least responsible for causing it, and who have the least resources to adapt to its impacts.</p>
        <p>Communities of color and low-income communities are often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and environmental pollution</p>

        <h2>Impact Of Climate Racism</h2>
        <p>Climate racism refers to the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards, such as pollution and toxic waste sites, on communities of color and low-income communities. </p>

        <h3>Health Disaparities</h3>
        <p> Exposure to environmental hazards can lead to a range of health issues, including respiratory problems, cancer, and developmental delays.</p>
        
        <h3>Economic Impact</h3>
        <p>The presence of environmental hazards can decrease property values and make it more difficult for these communities to attract businesses and economic development.</p>
        
        <h3>Forced Migration</h3>
        <p>Communities of color and Indigenous peoples are more likely to live in areas that are most vulnerable to climate change impacts, such as coastal regions and areas with poor air quality.</p>
